# Motivation

`yfR` facilitates importing data from Yahoo finance by organizing the data in the `tidy` format and speeding up the process using a cache system and parallel computing. `yfR` is the second and backwards-incompatible version of [BatchGetSymbols](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BatchGetSymbols), released in 2016 (see vignette "yfR and BatchGetSymbols"). 

In a nutshell, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) provides a vast repository of stock price data around the globe. It cover a signficant number of markets and assets, being used extensively in academic research and teaching. In order to import the financial data, all you need is a ticker (id of a stock, e.g. "FB" for [Meta platforms](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB&.tsrc=fin-srch)) and a time period. 

# Finding tickers

The easiest way to find the tickers of a company stock is to search for it in [Yahoo Finance's](https://finance.yahoo.com/) website. At the top page you'll find a search bar. 

![YF Search](search-yf.png?raw=true "Example of search in YF")
From there, you'll that a company can have many different stocks traded at different markets. As the example shows, Petrobras is traded at NYQ (New York Exchange), SAO (Sao Paulo/Brazil - B3 exchange) and BUE (Buenos Aires/Argentina Exchange), all with different symbols (tickers).


## Features

- Fetchs daily/weekly/monthly/annual stock prices/returns from yahoo finance and outputs a dataframe (tibble) in the long format (stacked data);

- A new feature called "collections" facilitates download of multiple tickers from a particular market/index. You can, for example, download data for all stocks in the SP500 index with a simple call to `yf_collection_get()`;

- A session-persistent smart cache system is available by default. This means that the data is saved locally and only missing portions are downloaded, if needed.

- All dates are compared to a benchmark ticker such as SP500 and, whenever an individual asset does not have a sufficient number of dates, the software drops it from the output. This means you can choose to ignore tickers with high number of missing dates.

- A customized function called `yf_convert_to_wide()` can transform the long dataframe into a wide format (tickers as columns), much used in portfolio optimization. The output is a list where each element is a different target variable (prices, returns, volumes).

- Parallel computing with package `furrr` is available, speeding up the data importation process.



## Warnings

- Yahoo finance data is far from perfect or reliable, specially for individual stocks. In my experience, using it for research code with stock **indices** is fine and I can match it with other data sources. But, adjusted stock prices for **individual assets** is messy as stock events such as splits or dividends are not properly registered. I was never able to match it with other data sources, specially for long time periods with lots of corporate events. My advice is to **never use the yahoo finance data of individual stocks in production** (research papers or academic documents -- thesis and dissertations). If adjusted price data of individual stocks is important for your research, **use other data sources** such as [EOD](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/), [SimFin](https://simfin.com/) or [Economática](https://economatica.com/).


## Installation

```
# CRAN (not yet available)
#install.packages('yfR')

# Github (dev version)
devtools::install_github('msperlin/yfR')
```


## A simple example of usage

```{r, results='hold'}
library(yfR)

# set options for algorithm
my_ticker <- 'FB'
first_date <- Sys.Date() - 30
last_date <- Sys.Date()

# fetch data
df_yf <- yf_get(tickers = my_ticker, 
                     first_date = first_date,
                     last_date = last_date)

# output is a tibble with data
head(df_yf)
```


# Acknowledgements

Package `yfR` is based on [quantmod](https://www.quantmod.com/) (@joshuaulrich) and uses one of its functions (`quantmod::getSymbols`) for fetching data from Yahoo Finance. I'm thankfull for the author for his work in keeping the package working properly.
